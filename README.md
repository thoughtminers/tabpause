# TabPause

A simple, transparent Chrome extension for pausing tabs to save memory and improve browser performance.

## Why TabPause?

In an era where AI-generated code is becoming increasingly common, **transparency matters**. TabPause is built with complete openness - every line of code is visible, auditable, and trustworthy.

**Key principles:**

- 🔍 **100% Transparent** - No hidden code, no obfuscation
- 🚫 **No Data Collection** - Zero tracking, zero telemetry
- ⚡ **Simple & Focused** - Does one thing well: pause tabs
- 🛡️ **Minimal Permissions** - Only requests `tabs` permission

## What it does

TabPause allows you to temporarily "pause" Chrome tabs by discarding them from memory while keeping them open in your tab bar. This is perfect for:

- Managing memory usage with many open tabs
- Keeping reference tabs without the performance cost
- Quickly pausing distracting tabs during focused work
- Saving network bandwidth

Simply click the extension icon to pause the current tab. Click again to resume it.
